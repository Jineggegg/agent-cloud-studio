 * - `status`: drives `chat_subscribed.isProcessing`, prevents double sends
 *   into the same session, and guards the synthetic-complete fallback in the
 *   chat handler (only emitted when a runtime died without completing).
 * - `lastSeq` / `events`: the per-run event log. Every live event gets a

 *   can replay exactly the events it missed via `chat.subscribe`.
